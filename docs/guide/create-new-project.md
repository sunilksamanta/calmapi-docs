# Create new Project

Generate a new CalmAPI REST Project by running
```shell
calmapi
```
CalmAPI will ask some basic questions like the **Name of the project** or **MongoDB URI** etc.

## Start

Move to the project directory and start the project by your favorite command.
```shell
npm start
```

Your REST API starts at `http://localhost:5001` by default.

Open the project in your favorite IDE, and it's ready for development.
