# Create new Project

Generate a new CalmAPI REST Project by running the following in your workspace and
answer some silly questions.

```shell
calmapi
```

## Start

Move to the project directory and start the project by following.
```shell
npm start
```

Your REST API starts at `http://localhost:5001` by default.

Open the project in your favorite IDE, and it's ready for development.
